# sonic-prebuilt
Prebuilt SONIC files for different genomes.

SONIC files for some human genome reference versions:

*    human_g1k_v37.sonic: SONIC file for Human Reference Genome GRCh37 (1000 Genomes Project version)
        Also download the reference genome at: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/human_g1k_v37.fasta.gz.
*    ucsc_hg19.sonic: SONIC file for the human reference genome, UCSC version build hg19.
        Also download the reference genome at: http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/chromFa.tar.gz. Deflate the tar archive and concatenate all chromosomes into a single FASTA file.
*    GRCh38.sonic: SONIC file for the human reference genome build 38, GATK bundle version.
        Also download the reference genome at: http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.chromFa.tar.gz. Deflate the tar archive and concatenate all chromosomes into a single FASTA file.
*    mm9.sonic: SONIC file for the mouse reference genome build 37; equivalent to UCSC mm9. 
	Also download the reference genome at: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm9/bigZips/chromFa.tar.gz
*    mm10.sonic: SONIC file for the mouse reference genome build 38; equivalent to UCSC mm10. 
	Also download the reference genome at: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/bigZips/chromFa.tar.gz
